                    I was <b>SO EXCITED</b> and a <i>lil bit</i> nervous to give this project to you — a project which
                    <u>I'll
                        improve</u> as I improve my
                    skills as a developer. I'm sorry that I didn’t chat as much; I was working on this, and I'm not much
                    of a
                    poetic person to write you a <i>SUPA GUD</i> poem about our luv. I don’t have that skill, so
                    <b>I coded this as a gift</b>. This is all about <u>us</u>.

                    <b>Thank you</b>, thank you, <b>THANK YOU</b> so much for being this patient with me. You may think
                    you
                    don’t show it as much, but I <u>notice</u> and <i>deeply appreciate</i> your efforts. Thank you for

                    Why did I do all of this for you?<br>
                    Simply, I’m broke <i>heh..</i> and I wanted to make something <u>special</u> — something we could
                    treasure
                    forever, improve over the years, and something that would always remind us of <b>our love</b>.

                    You always gifted me things, asked me if I wanted this or that, and always <u>supported</u> me.
                    Since I don’t got <i>munz</i> right now, <b>this is all I got</b> :'>
