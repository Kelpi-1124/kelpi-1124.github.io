9 months later.. (No not a kid, im waiting until marriage!)
happy monthsary my hunny.

I was SO EXCITED to give this project to you, a project which ill improve as i improve my skills as
a developer. Sorry that i didnt chat as much, as i was working on this, and im not that much of a poetic 
person to write you a mind blowingly good poetry about our love,i simply dont have that skill. so i coded 
this as a gift!! This is all about us, and i hope u like it:>

Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU so much for being this patient with me, you may not show it as much, but i
appreciate your efforts so much, thank you for even putting an effort for me. i want to be by your side forever,
and be with you in the name of jesus.

Why did i do all of this for you?
because you've truly showed me your love, cared for me even if i was a stubborn person. you were there when i was at 
the lowest points of my life, and i just freaking LOVE you so much for that. i want to do the same for you.
you always gifted me things, asking if i wanted this or that, and i thank you for that. since i dont got munz rn,
this is all i got :'>
